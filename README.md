# FlappyClone-Java

FlappyClone-Java is a simple yet challenging Flappy Bird remake built using Java Swing. The game features smooth controls, a fixed jump height, and increasing pipe speed for added difficulty. Players navigate obstacles using the spacebar in a fast-paced, engaging challenge.

## Features
- Classic Flappy Bird mechanics with Java Swing.
- Pipes move faster after every 4 successful jumps.
- Clean UI with "Tap to Begin" and "Game Over" screens.
- Simple and efficient game logic using JPanel and Timers.

## How to Play
1. Press the **spacebar** to make the bird jump.
2. Navigate through the pipes without colliding.

4. If you hit a pipe or fall, the game restarts.
